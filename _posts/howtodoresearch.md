#### About Research Proposal

* **tell a story with vivid contrasts.**

> One of my favorite recipes for telling a story is to set up the problem context, explain why the problem is important and hard to solve, and then *draw a succinct, stark contrast* *between your approach and every other previous approach.*  For example, many research proposals I wrote about email spam filtering followed this recipe: (1) spam filtering is an important problem; (2) *everyone else* has been trying to filter spam by looking at the content of email messages; (3) *in contrast*, I will develop spam filters that discriminate good from bad based on the network traffic, without looking at the content of the messages at all.  I’d then proceed to explain why this was a promising approach and likely to result in new breakthroughs (which it ultimately did).

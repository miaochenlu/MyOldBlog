goal:

> After graduation, I want to be a teacher, a researcher,  learning,  exploring and sharing.

My plan 

in the short-term, I want to study abroad

> * Research experience
> * English
> * Coding skill
> * Consolidate the basic knowledge



challange:

> The biggest challenge is myself. 
>
> I'm not that brave, hesitant before or even after making choices, always doubting myself. I'm not that movitated. I want to leave all the stuff behind and seize the moment to enjoy and relax. 
>
> The other me ask me to fight.
>
> I'm denying my self, fighting against myself. But there is no winner, I win means I lose.  



How to be motivated? 

> Emmm, hard question. My high school teacher asked me to find the answer, but until now, I'm still exploring.
>
> Often, when I'm going do something, the first thing comes to my mind is "I need to do that", not "I want to do that". So if one day, I could say "I want to do that", I would be really motivated. Maybe that day is getting closer, hahaha .

# BNF terminologies

***lexeme***: 

> is the lowest level syntactic unit of a language  (e.g., ZU, Hangzhou, is, in)

***token***

> is a category of lexemes (e.g.,  place)



***BNF grammer*** consists of:

> * The set of tokens  and  lexemes (terminals（终结符）)
> * The set of non-terminals(非终结符) eg.<sentence\>, <verb\>
> * The start symbol起始符号<sentence>
> * The set of production rules 
>   * eg. <sentence\> --> <noun\> <verb\> <preposition\> <noun\>

1. Any word or words enclosed in angle brackets, `< >`,  is  a  <u>nonterminal</u>  -- it stands for some string (it’s like a string variable)

2. The symbol`  ::= or -> ` means “is defined as”

3. The symbol   `|   `means “or”

4. Anything else is a terminal -- it stands for itself



Some BNF examples

> * Suppose that an “unsigned integer” consists of one or more digits (but there is no limit to the number of digits)
>
> ```cpp
> <unsigned integer> ::= <digit> | <unsigned integer><digit>
> ```
>
> * Suppose that (in some computer language) a variable consists of letters, digits, and underscores, but must begin with a letter
>
> ```cpp
> <variable> ::= <letter> 
>   						|<variable><letter>
>   						|<variable><digit>
>   						|<variable>_
> ```
>
> * Suppose that a variable is as before, but can only be six characters long
>
> ```cpp
> <variable> ::= <letter> | <letter><v2> | <letter><v2><v2>
>   						|<letter><v2><v2><v2> | <letter><v2><v2><v2><v2>
>   						|<letter><v2><v2><v2><v2><v2>
> <v2> ::= <letter> | <digit> | _
> ```



## Derivation

A ***<u>leftmost derivation</u>*** is one in which the ***<u>leftmost nonterminal</u>*** in each sentential form is the one that is expanded

## ambiguity

> If a sentential form can be generated by two or more  distinct parse trees, the grammar is said to be ambiguous, because it has two or more different meanings

example:

```cpp
<exp>-><exp>+<exp> | <exp>*<exp> | (<exp>) | a | b | c
```

> Cause of the problem:
>
> Grammar lacks semantic of operator precedence

# EBNF

* `*` (The Kleene Star): means 0 or more occurrences

* `+`(The Kleene Cross): means 1 or more occurrences

* `?` means 0 or 1 occurrences (sometimes `[ ... ]`used instead)

* Use of parentheses for grouping

Read DHTM and have a general idea!



## general idea

NVM, persistent, demand crash recoverability$\Rightarrow$ACID Transactions$\Rightarrow$Software based signigicant performance overheads.  

Propose DHTM.  

Techniques:  

* leverages a ***commercial HTM*** to provide ***atomic visibility*** and extends it with hardware support for ***redo logging*** to provide ***atomic durability***
* extend the supported ***transaction size*** (from being L1-limited to LLC- limited

Result:DHTM outperforms the state-of- the-art by an average of 21% to 25%

## Dive into details

### 1 What is the problem?

#### 1.1 New things came out, brought opportunities

NVM's emergence provides a high-bandwidth and low-latency alternative for durability.   

##### New challenge

It's good, but could it be better? What if a crash happens? Could it still guarantee durability?



How fast can we enforce ACID in the presence of fast persistent memory

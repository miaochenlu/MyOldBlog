#### Where do you find Information?

* At rest(in storage)
* In transit(communication)
* In use(computation)



#### Information Storage

* Essentially writing until recently
* Electrical in 20th Century
* Growing explosively at every level

#### Communication Over Distance

* Transport of writing
* Heliograph: use mirrors to reflect the sun
* Telegraph
* Radio and Television

* Microwave
* Satellite
* Optical Fiber

#### Information in Use

* Computation by hand
* Hand calculaters in early 20th Century
* COmputers circa 1950
* Transistors, IC's etc.





#### Gems of 20th Century Intelligence

* Photint(satellites)
* Sigint

<br>

### Signals Intelligence 

<center>World War I </center>

<center>RADIO</center>

* Interception
* Direction Finding
* Traffic Analysis
* Cryptanalysis

All intelligence derived from the study of radio transmissions and other communications.

<br>

#### Signals Intelligence(SIGINT)

* Comint
* Elint
* FISINT
* RADINT
* TELINT



#### Structure of SIGINT

* Access
* Collection
* Processing
* Exploitation
* Analysis
* Reporting
* Dissemination



#### Access

#### Collection

Recording, storage and management of signals

<br>

#### Processing

Select what you want. Filter out what you don't.

#### Exploitation

Mostly cryptanalysis

#### Analysis

Intelligence analysis

#### Reporting(report writing)

We intercepted this signal and this is what it means

#### Dissemination

Delivering finished intelligence to the customers

<br>

**SIGINT Trends I**

Away from vertical integration and toward shared resources

**SIGINT Trends II**

Toward real-time targeting

**SIGINT Trends III**

From passive to active

**SIGNIT Threds IV**

From nuggest to low-grade ore



### Protection of Information

* At rest
* In transit
* In use

#### Protection of Storage

* Mostly locking it up in a safe
* Crypto only comes into play in recent years

<br>

#### Protection of Data in Transit

* Trusted courier or system
* Guarded wires
* Restricted routing
* Oxygen absorption bank
* Narrow-beam laser
* Cryptography

#### Protection of Data in Use

* Mostly guarding the computer
* Partly homomorphic encryption
* Fully homomorphic encryption



### Why cryptography?

* When cryptography is applicable, it is typically the best solution
* An encrypted message is no longer sensitive
* Can choose to send it fast, reliably, or cheaply

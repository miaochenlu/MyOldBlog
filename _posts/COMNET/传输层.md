# The transport layer

# 1. The Transport Service

* transport layer services
  * To provide efficient, ***reliable,*** and cost effective service to its users, normally processes in the application layer.
  * To make use of the services provided by the network layer.

* the transport entity

# 2. Elements of Transport Protocols



```python
if (packet.seq see before and time is short (<T))
	discard packet
if (packet.seq see before and time is large (>T))
	accept packet
```

How to realize

1. Restrict packet lifetime
2. use time-of-day clock to limit sending rate

### error control and flow control

* Error detection:

  * The link layer checksum protects a frame while it crosses a single link.

  * The transport layer checksum protects a segment while it crosses an entire network path. It is an end-to-end check, which is not the same as having a check on every link.

End-to-end argument: transport check is essential for correctness while link layer check is valuable for performance.

# 1. Introduction

Network security problems can be divided roughly into four interwined areas: secrecy, authentication, nonrepudiation, and integrity control. 

1. secrecy机密性

> to keep information out of the hands of unauthorized users. 

2. Authentication认证

> to determine whom you are talking to before revealing sensitive information or entering into a business deal. (to authenticate people by recognizing their faces, voices, and handwriting). 
>
> 伪装通信

3. Nonrepudiation不可否认性

> 比如银行转账成功了之后，这个交易就不可否认
>
> 所以要保证完成之后依然有证据能表明这条消息就是你发的

4. Integrity完整性

>  How can you be sure that a message you received was really the one sent and not something that a malicious adversary modified in transit or concocted. 
>
> 消息没有被篡改过



Every layer has something to contribute: 

- Physical layer: Wiretapping can be foiled by enclosing transmission lines in sealed tubes containing argon gas at high pressure. (not always work) 
- Data link layer: Packets on a point-to-point line can be encoded as they leave one machine and decoded as they enter another. (not routed) 
- Network layer: Firewalls can be installed to keep packets in or keep packets out. 
- Transport layer: Entire connections can be encrypted, end to end, that is, process to process. 
- Application layer: Issues such as authentication and nonrepudiation can only be solved at the application layer. 

# 2. Cryptography

Encryptaion: $E_k(P)=C$

Decryption: $D_k(C)=D_k(E_k(P))=P$



**Kerchoff’s principle:** all algorithms must be public while the key is secret. 



- From the cryptanalyst's point of view, the cryptanalysis problem has three principal variations: 
  * ciphertext only, 唯密文
  *  known plaintext, and 已知明文[我知道你发送的明文和密文，分析出key]
  * chosen plaintext. 选择明文 [我选择发送的明文，然后拿到密文，分析出key]



### Two principles

- Redundancy: All encrypted messages must contain some redundancy, that is, information not needed to understand the message. All messages must contain considerable redundancy so that active intruders cannot send random junk and have it be interpreted as a valid message. 
- Freshness: Some measures must be taken to prevent active intruders from playing back old messages (replay attack). 



### Substitution Ciphers

#### A. Caesar

key: 平移k个字母的k是key

#### B. Monoalphabetic substitution

key: 26个字母对应表

可以用频率分析破解



#### C. Transposition Ciphers

Transposition ciphers reorder the letters but do not disguise them. In contrast, substitution ciphers preserve the order of the letter but disguise them. 



#### D. One-Time Pads



# 3. Symmetric-keyalgorithms 



### Cipher Modes

#### i. Electronic Code Book Mode[ECB]

Leslie can substitute 4th block with 12th block! 

#### ii. Cipher block chaining

#### iii. Cipher Feedback Mode
